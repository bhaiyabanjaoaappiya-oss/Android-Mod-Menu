    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks out your repository code.
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Java Development Kit (JDK). Gradle needs Java to run.
      # Most modern Android projects use JDK 17.
      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '17'
          distribution: 'temurin'

      # Step 3: Setup Gradle
      # This powerful action handles caching of Gradle dependencies,
      # which makes future builds much faster.
      - name: Setup Gradle
        uses: gradle/actions/setup-gradle@v3

      # Step 4: Make the Gradle Wrapper script executable.
      # This is a good practice to prevent permission errors.
      - name: Make gradlew executable
        run: chmod +x ./gradlew

      # Step 5: Build the Release APK.
      # This is the main command that compiles your Java/Kotlin and C++ code
      # and packages it into a final, signed APK.
      - name: Build Release APK
        run: ./gradlew assembleRelease

      # Step 6: Upload the generated APK as an artifact.
      # This makes the final APK available for download from the workflow summary page.

        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
